This is a simple magic 8 ball app made using Flutter, to learn about changing the state. The app updates the state by changing one variable to access different images with various magic 8 ball outputs. 

The resources and inspiration for this project come from the 2020 Flutter Developer Bootcamp with Dart by Dr. Angela Yu.
